# JS-Advanced-Concepts-Study
Design patterns are formulized answers to common problems that are reusable, formulization of best practices

Builder- looks useful for taking complex tasks and returning them as simpler tasks.

Facade Pattern I understand the facade pattern exists to try and simply
 things for the end user, but I am not really sure I grasp how it all fits.

Observer Pattern 
The observer pattern seems really useful for more complex actions in js, 
in sequences.  

destructor seems incredibly useful to unpack data and have access to it.
spread
Spread seems like a much easier way to deal with items in arrays and moving them to objects

memoization
It calls excisting values that have already been calculated to make the code run
more efficently. 


callbacks
does work in the background until called, it allows code to run asynch, it lets
you order how code is performed

The clarity and instructional value of the video content.
Some of these videos were much better than others.  The desturcting  one jumped around so much it was very confusing to try and follow along, however by the end I felt like I grasped the concept, if not the application. The spread video I thought was well done and pretty clear.  The callbacks video also made sense even if there wasn't really practice to do.  The async video was overwhelming, I have watched it three times now and I get the idea of why it matters and is important but I don't really understand how to implement it.

How these advanced concepts could affect your coding practices.
There are a lot of interesting concepts in these videos and I see a lot of ways to make the code more efficent and flexible, but it is so many concepts I feel completely overwhelmed by then.
Which areas you feel confident in and those that you are curious to delve deeper into.
I don't feel confident or comfortable in any of the concepts shown in the video.  It was ton to get through and a lot of the videos referened things we haven't talked about or experineced like apis.
